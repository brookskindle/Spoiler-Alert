Spoiler Alert
=============
The website that spoils things for you.

## Installation
The following software is required: `git virtualenvwrapper python-pip`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brookskindle/Spoiler-Alert.git
cd Spoiler-Alert
mkvirtualenv spoiler
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
That's it! All that is left is to run `python spoiler.py` to start the
webserver. Do note, however, that debug mode is currently turned **on**, so
don't go hosting this unless you turn debugging mode off.
